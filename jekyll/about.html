## About

I am a builder living and working in Singapore. I like it here because there is tons of great cheap eats, and the weather never makes me think about what to wear.

All my life I have loved building things, and I cannot help but get passionate when I see a problem that I can fix. I have explored building projects in many different ways and scales, but found building software solutions the most rewarding.

Currently I am working on [Cypher Forge](https://www.cypherforge.com), which hopes to fix the way institutions trade cryptocurrency.
